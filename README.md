# Bird-Detection
Bird Detection using deep learning models like YOLOv5 to identify and locate birds in images or video streams.

#Features
   1. Detects birds in real-time or static images

   2. Uses YOLOv5 for fast and accurate detection

   3. Highlights detected birds with bounding boxes

   4. Easy to retrain on custom bird datasets
